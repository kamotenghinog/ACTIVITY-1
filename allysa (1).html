       My life is full of mystery. I have everything I could wish for because being born in this world is a blessing for me. I love things that makes me happy, like eating korean foods, watching movies, buying gifts for my loved ones and studying hard. I'm an honor student from first year Junior High student to fourth year Junior High School. I graduated with High Honors in Grade 10. That's how my life goes. Study here,study there, study everywhere. I love listening to other people because I don't have that strong relationship with my family. We often talk and I feel like we're living in a different worlds. I don't have much information to share with you but Im' happy that I get to share my story to you! And the most important thing about myself is I like helping other people. Even if it's a needs, problems andeverything they want so that I can help them have this one lesson that I learned from that,Empathy is more than just a word; it's a life skill that can make a world of difference. 
</br>
I wondered,what would've happened if all of us learned to help each other Even though it's a small incident

t

because it can affect our way of thinking, how

we'll face school for moving forward... etc. I do trust that we all are capable of handling it on our own but communication is the key for that. In a world where communication gaps can sometimes widen as kids grow older, this simple action emphasized the significance of fostering an open dialogue with our friends. Your effortstoday are shaping a tomorrow where empathyisn't just a concept but a way of life.
